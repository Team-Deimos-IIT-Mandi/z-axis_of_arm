## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the **SolidWorks assembly** of the **vertical axis rotation subsystem** of the robotic arm for the Mars Rover developed at **IIT Mandi**.  
The subsystem enables **precise rotation around the vertical axis**, ensuring robust and reliable performance in planetary exploration environments.

---

## ⚙️ Assembly Description
The subsystem consists of:

- **Base Plate**  
  - Reinforced with stiffeners for rigidity  
  - Modified design for improved robustness  

- **Motor & Shaft Plate with Clamps**  
  - Secure mounting for motor and shaft  
  - Shaft passes through clamps with **shaft collar** and **bearing** attached  

- **Pulley & Belt Drive System**  
  - Shaft pulley: **22 teeth, 12 mm bore, 3M pitch (S3M), 10 mm width**  
  - Motor pulley: **22 teeth, K-type, 8 mm bore, 3M pitch, 10 mm width**  
  - Coupled via **3M pitch, 10 mm wide belt**  
  - Belt tensioners on both sides (adjustable) → increases belt contact with pulleys  

---

## 🔧 Key Features
- **Modified Base Plate** → stronger and more rigid  
- **New Motor Integration** → improved torque and efficiency  
- **Belt Drive System** → smoother transmission and reduced backlash  
- **Adjustable Belt Tensioners** → enhanced reliability and pulley contact
